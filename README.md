# YAPT: Yet Another PyTorch Trainer

A simple framework that takes inspiration from all the best outside.

We developed this library to help (force) ourselves and our students to be organized when writing code and designing experiments. 

The goal is to have a non-monolithic code base that is easily debuggable and scalable.
